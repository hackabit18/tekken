# ONE TAP : 
An extension to traditional SOS Application

## Project Idea :
	SOS notifications to nearby devices 
	Marked Mode
	Child Mode
	Call and Send location to Nearby Authorities
	Status Upload of an emergency on social platforms

Usually when we are in need of help ,the traditional method of SOS which to send messages to emergency contacts does not help as they are not near. 

## SOS notifications to nearby devices : 
This app solves this problem of lack of quick response by sending location of the victim device to all users of the app within a certain radius. The radius keeps on increasing up to certain until certain user is willing to help and thus would respond. To keep the system well working a reward system is present.

## Marked Mode : 
There are few dangerous locations and hazardous areas according to government data set. Users are notified when they enter such locations. 

## Child Mode : 
Parent device can track a child device along a set path and if child deviates from that path, the parent is notified.

# Tools and Technologies : 
Android Studio, Firebase, GeoFire

# Instructions : 
Download the latest android studio from the link https://developer.android.com/studio/ . Select open an existing project and then build and run the project.

# Future Scope :
The idea can be implemented in a better way to improve the SOS features available . People in nearby places can help us faster than those in our emergency contact list and they will be willing to help if reward system is added too. Keeping this in mind , many features can be implemented .
